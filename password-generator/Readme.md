# "Project Name"
## :page_facing_up: Description

This project allows a user to choose a password length, generate one that includes or excludes uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and/or numbers, and copy the result to their clipboard. 
 
This is Day 31/50 of Brad Traversey's 50 Projects in 50 Days course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23594652?start=15#content)



## Challenge

I was able to get the password to generate, but realized when it was displayed in my results bar, my copy-to-clipboard button disappeared.

I thought the width of the bar was set up incorrectly in my CSS, but it turns out I had mistakenly put my clipboard button inside of the result span tag in my HTML.


## New Tricks
