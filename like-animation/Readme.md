# "Like Animation"
 
## :page_facing_up: Description
>This project uses CSS and vanilla JS to create a heart icon that appears when the user clicks on a photo

This is Day 29/50 of Brad Traversey's 50 Projects in 50 Days course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23594652?start=15#content)


## New Tricks

Offsets
>It was really useful for Brad to walk through the steps of figuring out where a user clicks on the screen using offsets in our JS.

Dblclick Event Listener
> Brad also opted to use a customized version of a 'click' event instead of 'dblclick' to determine whether a user double clicked the photo or not. He did this by figuring out how much time occured between clicks. If it was less than 800ms, it would be considered a 'like'.
