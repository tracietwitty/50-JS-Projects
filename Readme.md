# :bread:  Toast Messages
## Description
> This project builds JS functions that reveal toast messages when the user clicks a button on screen.


We created arrays of notification types and messages then built custom functions to choose a random one of each to display when the user clicks a "Show Notification". 



This is Day 27/50 of Brad Traversey's 50 Projects in 50 Days course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23594652?start=15#content)

## Challenges

> I tried to build the createNotification() button myself, but forgot to add both message and type to the expected parameters. 


## New Tricks

> Always nice to be reminded how to choose a random item from an array with `Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)` !
